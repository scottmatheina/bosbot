Announcement 9

Article and Application, "Reverse ICO Partner Program" https://boscoin.io/pf/

What is RIPP (Reverse ICO Partner Program) ?
- RIPP is financed by BOSNet, the mainnet for public financing based on blockchain.
- RIPP is targeting reverse-ICO firms that are already operational with their own business models, and looking for additional financing through blockchain based ICOs or Public Financing, not the traditional financial system.
- Our partners can conduct business quickly, without the need for extensive technological investments into the blockchain. Furthermore, raising post-ICO capital on BOSNet through Public Financing is drastically cheaper than using the traditional financial system with its high fees.
