"BOScoin has proposed a new solution to solve the high financial commission\
 problem of Project Financing through ‘Public Financing’ and implemented with\
 a program called RIPP (Reverse ICO Partner Program).\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/pf/",
##
"Membership Reward PF:\
Public Financing is credit creation by our community to accelerate the expansion\
 of the BOScoin ecosystem. It is additional coin issuance for a specific purpose,\
 and approved by the Congress Network.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/pf/",

# Quotes from White Paper 2.0 			#
#						#
#################################################

"Public Financing creates credit, not through decisions made by a central bank or government,\
 but through the collective consensus of individuals who use and trade real credit.\
 BOScoin has already introduced a governance system called the Congress Network to\
 give its participants decision-making powers. The BOScoin community can propose,\
 review, and vote on new token issuance through the Congress Network. The community\
 as a whole has financial sovereignty, rather than it being given to a concentrated few.\
 The community members determine the size, volume, and base price of issuance, as\
 well as the terms of its usage. The community’s decision will be executed by Trust\
 Contracts in BOScoin. Real economic assets acquired through the issuance of BOScoins\
 will be used by the community as commons, and thus PF will remain “public”.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 3)",
 ##
"BOS team is not trying to create a token platform that simply uses a blockchain,\
 nor a pseudo currency for a specific purpose. We want to organize and create a de\
 facto global currency and credit creation system, one that is trusted by the global\
 community to successfully replace the current one.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 5)",
 ##
"It is necessary not only to utilize the power of capital’s credit generation, but\
 also to 1) overcome the problems of shareholder capitalism and provide a way for\
 everyone to participate in the market, 2) enable those who provide credit for the\
 economy to participate in its financial decisions, and 3) define a production system\
 as a common resource if the production requires or utilizes consumer activity but\
 does not benefit them.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 9)",
 ##
"BOScoin introduced the Congress Network to reinforce participants' decision-making power,\
 but neither BOScoin nor most cryptocurrencies sufficiently satisfied the three conditions\
 of a 'new economic system'. The sharing of the means of production was often not even\
 considered. There is a movement, however, that maintains that a system of production\
 created by the global community is a common resource and must provide access to everyone.\
 This is called the Commons movement.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 10)",
 ##
"If a community agrees that a particular resource is commons, the wealth produced using the\
 commons ought to be shared by the community. This is a fundamental and effective alternative\
 to the vicious cycle of a dying consumer base and dropping labor income.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 10)",
 ##
"Impact investment is a good way for the community to secure the commons, but if driven\
 by a selected few, it is certainly not the most efficient solution to the problems\
 of the current economic system. However, it is clear that impact investments can\
 increase social value.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 11)",
 ##
"We believe that the technical strategy of White Paper 1.0 remains valid, and it\
 remains in development. Thus, this white paper will examine the strategies and policies\
 of the current cryptocurrency market from a socioeconomic point of view rather than\
 the technical and analyze the problems.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 13)",
 ##
"In order to prevent a fragmented monetary space, BOScoin once pushed for Dapp development\
 through the Commons Budget. After meeting many companies for collaboration, however,\
 we found that what they wanted was to create credit through an ICO more than to use\
 BOScoin platform itself.\
\nIn order to solve the problem of fragmented credit creation systems by the DappICO\
 strategy, we propose Public Financing (PF).\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 14 & 15)",
 ##
"Public Financing is a way for individuals who use and trade real credit to make\
 collective decisions to create credit. Rather than be dictated by a central bank\
 or government, the community creates its own credit.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/wp-content/themes/boscoin/src/pdf/BOScoinWhitePaper_2.0_EN.pdf\
 (pg. 15)",
##
"Unlike other crypto platforms, BOScoin can offer Public Fianncing because it has\
 a governance system called the Congress Network.\
