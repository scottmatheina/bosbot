'Article and Application, "Reverse ICO Partner Program"\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/pf/\
\n\
What is RIPP (Reverse ICO Partner Program)?\
\n- RIPP is financed by BOSNet, the mainnet for public financing based on blockchain.\
\n- RIPP is targeting reverse-ICO firms that are already operational with their own business\
 models, and looking for additional financing through blockchain based ICOs or Public Financing,\
 not the traditional financial system.\
\n- Our partners can conduct business quickly, without the need for extensive technological\
 investments into the blockchain. Furthermore, raising post-ICO capital on BOSNet through\
 Public Financing is drastically cheaper than using the traditional financial system with\
 its high fees.',
