"Article and Application, 'Reverse ICO Partner Program'\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/pf/\
\n\
What is RIPP (Reverse ICO Partner Program)?\
\n- RIPP is financed by BOSNet, the mainnet for public financing based on\
 blockchain.\
\n- RIPP is targeting reverse-ICO firms that are already operational with their\
 own business models, and looking for additional financing through blockchain\
 based ICOs or Public Financing, not the traditional financial system.\
\n- Our partners can conduct business quickly, without the need for extensive\
 technological investments into the blockchain. Furthermore, raising post-ICO\
 capital on BOSNet through Public Financing is drastically cheaper than using\
 the traditional financial system with its high fees.",

\n- BOScoin offers three alternatives - credit creation through participation,\
 democratic impact investments and communization of certain assets to form a new\
 'Project Financing (PF)'' concept to power better capitalism, solving the high\
 interest rate problem in conventional PF.\
\n- BOScoin plans to release 'BOSnet', a blockchain based mainnet optimized for\
 PF scheduled for Nov/Dec 2018.\
