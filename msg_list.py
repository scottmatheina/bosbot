"Article and Application, 'Reverse ICO Partner Program'\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/pf/\
\n\
What is RIPP (Reverse ICO Partner Program)?\
\n- RIPP is financed by BOSNet, the mainnet for public financing based on\
 blockchain.\
\n- RIPP is targeting reverse-ICO firms that are already operational with their\
 own business models, and looking for additional financing through blockchain\
 based ICOs or Public Financing, not the traditional financial system.\
\n- Our partners can conduct business quickly, without the need for extensive\
 technological investments into the blockchain. Furthermore, raising post-ICO\
 capital on BOSNet through Public Financing is drastically cheaper than using\
 the traditional financial system with its high fees.",
##
"We have published a one page brochure covering basic platform information.\
\nhttps://boscoin.io/data/brochure.html\
\n- BOScoin is a finance blockchain project to hack capitalism in the most capitalist way.\
\n- BOScoin offers three alternatives - credit creation through participation,\
 democratic impact investments and communization of certain assets to form a new\
 'Project Financing (PF)' concept to power better capitalism, solving the high\
 interest rate problem in conventional PF.\
\n- BOScoin plans to release 'BOSnet', a blockchain based mainnet optimized for\
 PF scheduled for Nov 15, 2018 launch.\
\n- BOScoin is running a 'Reverse ICO Partner Program' to discover and foster\
 companies in need of PF through reverse ICOs.",

"Public Financing creates credit, not through decisions made by a central bank or government,\
 but through the collective consensus of individuals who use and trade real credit.\
 BOScoin has already introduced a governance system called the Congress Network to\
 give its participants decision-making powers. The BOScoin community can propose,\
 review, and vote on new token issuance through the Congress Network. The community\
 as a whole has financial sovereignty, rather than it being given to a concentrated few.\
 The community members determine the size, volume, and base price of issuance, as\
 well as the terms of its usage. The community’s decision will be executed by Trust\
 Contracts in BOScoin. Real economic assets acquired through the issuance of BOScoins\
 will be used by the community as commons, and thus PF will remain “public”.\
